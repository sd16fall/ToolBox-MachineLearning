1. The general trend in the curve is the higher the percentage of data used for training, the higher the accuracy of the test. 
2. The lower half of the curve appears to have more noise than the top half of the curve, which may be because there is less data to build a model with and thus, we cannot expect very representative models. 
3. The greater the number of trials, the more smooth the curve. At 100 trials, I start to get a smoother curve with some repetitive bumps. When increased to 500, I get a fairly smooth curve. 
4. When the C value is increased, the computer's accuracy at lower percentages of data seems to improve. When the C value is dexreased, the computer's accuracy at higher percentages of data seems to improve.
