1) What is the general trend in the curve?
	-As the percentage of data used for training increased, the accuracy on the test data increased as well. 		The more data you have the more accurate you should be when using the model. There is also some aspects of 		over fitting when having the percentage for the training data be so high. 

2) Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
	-The middle of the curve looks most noisy, around 30%-60%. I'm not exactly sure why but i think it has to 		do with the randomness being allocated evenly across both sets and thus leads to a noisy curve as the 		percentages equal out. 

3) How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
	-With 50 trials, the curve was almost a straight line. This is due to how the increases in the number of 		trials. smooths out randomness and outliers. 

4) Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?  If you want to know why this happens, see this Wikipedia page as well as the documentation for LogisticRegression in scikit-learn.
	-As C increases, the curve becomes more accurate immediately an then begins to level off. The rate of 		increases in accuracy begins to decrease. In general, the curve is more accurate. 
	-As C decreases, the curve gets worse as the percentage used for training increases. In general, the curve 		gets less accurate.
