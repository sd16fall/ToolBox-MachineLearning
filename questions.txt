1. What is the general trend in the curve?
The general trend in the curve is that as the percentage of data used for training increases, so does
the computer's accuracy on the test set. This means the more data you give the computer, the better the computer learns.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?  Why?
The parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others occurs mainly between 0%-50% on the graph.
This may be because at those percentages there is less data for the computer to test with.

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
I tested different trial sizes at 50, 100,and 200 trials. I was able to finally get a fairly smooth
curve at 300 trials with very little noise.

4. Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens?
The higher the C value, the higher the computer's accuracy at lower percentages of data. I tested this with C value equal to 1.
The lower the C value, the noisier the curve becomes with a wilder variation. I tested this portion with C = 10**-20.
