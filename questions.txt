Question 1:
As the training percentage increases, the accuracy of the test data set increases.

Question 2:
Between 30% and 70% for the training data set seems to be the most noisy.
Its possible the data used to create the model is much different than the data for the test portion, leading to variability in accuracy.

Question 3:
100 trials seems to really smooth out the curve.

Question 4:
By changing C to equal 20**-10, the graph became overall more noisy, but the variation wasn't as much as it was before.
Before, the variability was a lot between 30-70, now the whole graph has some noise, but not to the extent as before.
